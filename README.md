 # Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This is a Machine Learning Project based on classification and then predicting the Customer Churn for ABC Bank. In this project few ML algorithms are performed like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SGD, LGBM and XGBoost to find out the best ML algorithm among, so that the prediction can performed using the model whose accuracy is high and better performance. I hope you enjoy it :) . 

The dataset consists of:
* customer_id : contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank.
* credit_score : can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank.
* country : a customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank.
* gender : it’s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank.
* age : this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.
* tenure : refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.
* balance : also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.
* products_number : refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.
* credit_card : denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant, since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.
* active_member : active customers are less likely to leave the bank.
* estimated_salary : as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.
* churn : 1 if the client has left the bank during some period or 0 if he/she has not.
